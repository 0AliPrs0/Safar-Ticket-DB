## üìä Queries

### Informational
- List all available trips between two cities on a given date.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stored Procedures

The project includes several stored procedures, such as:

- `GetUserTicketsByEmail(email)` ‚Äì Show all tickets for a user by email.
- `GetTripsBetweenCities(origin, destination, date)` ‚Äì Show trips between two cities on a date.
- `GetMostPopularRoutes(limit)` ‚Äì Returns the top N routes by ticket count.
- `GetRevenueByMonth(year)` ‚Äì Revenue breakdown by month.
- `GetTripsByVehicleType(type)` ‚Äì Lists trips of a specific vehicle type.
- `CheckSeatAvailability(trip_id)` ‚Äì Returns available seats for a trip.
- `GetCityTraffic(city_name)` ‚Äì Calculates the number of departures and arrivals for a city.
- `GetAveragePriceByVehicleType()` ‚Äì Average trip price per vehicle type.

These procedures are located in `stored_procedures.sql`.

## üß™ Sample Data

Each table is populated with **at least 10 sample records** for testing. Sample entries include cities, users, vehicle types, and various scheduled trips.

---


## ‚úÖ Design Notes

- All tables are designed in **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
- Relational integrity is enforced using foreign key constraints.
- Indexes are used on frequent search columns to improve performance.

---

## üìå Future Improvements
- Add user authentication and admin roles.
- Support for ticket cancellation and refunds.
- Real-time seat availability checking.
